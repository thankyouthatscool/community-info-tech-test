## Project Setup

- Needs AWS to run properly.

## Authentication

- There's no proper authentication in the project. I have three "users" saved in the database,

## Issues

- On mobile, at least on Android, MUI's Auto Select does not blur when panning the map, so the focus keeps on coming back to the input, bringing up the keyboard. Need to either close the Auto Select component manually, press on a pin to open up a drawer, or press an element on the Bottom Navigation.
